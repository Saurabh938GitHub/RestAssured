- API: application programming interface which acts as a bridge between client(front end) and server (back end)

- End point: Address where API is hosted on the Server.

- HTTP methods which are commonly used to communicate with Rest APIâ€™s are: GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE (CRUD operations)

- GET http method: The GET method is used to extract information from the given server using a given URI. While using GET request, it should only extract     data and should have no other effect on the data. No Payload/Body required
How to send input data in GET?
Ans: Using Query Parameters

- POST http method: A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.
How to send input data in POST?
Ans: Using Form Parameters /Body Payload

- PUT http method: Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

- DELETE http method: Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.


- End Point Request URL can be constructed as below: Base URL/resource/(Query/Path)Parameters

- Resources: Resources represent API/Collection which can be accessed from the Server like for google its maps/images/search

- Path Parameters: Path parameters are variable parts of a URL path. They are typically used to point to a specific resource within a collection, such as a user identified by ID
Example: https://amazon.com/orders/1123343 --  here 'https://amazon.com/' is server, 'orders' is resource and '1123343' is path parameter/specific order

- Query Parameters: Query Parameter is used to sort/filter the resources. Query Parameters are identified with '?'
Example: https://amazon.com/orders?sort_by=2/20/2020 --  here 'https://amazon.com/' is server, 'orders' is resource and 'sort_by=2/20/2020' is query parameter

- Headers/Cookies: Headers represent the meta-data associated with the API request and response. In layman terms, we were sending Additional details to API to process our request.
Example : Authorization details

- Rest Assured: Java based library used to test restful web services/apis.

- Rest Assured has three main methods:
  given()- it takes all inputs like queryParam(), header(), body()
  when()- it submits the API by taking resource and http method type like POST
  then()- validates the response with methods like assertThat(), header(), body()

- Extract response as string: String response= .then().extract().response().asString();

- To Parse extracted response as JSON: JsonPath class. his class takes a string nput and converts it into Json.
  String response= .then().extract().response().asString();
  JsonPath js= new JsonPath(response);
  String placeId= js.getString("place_id");
